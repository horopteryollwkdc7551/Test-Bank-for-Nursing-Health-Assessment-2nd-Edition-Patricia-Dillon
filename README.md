Throughout the text, you will find a unique body system integration, case studies strategically placed three times in each chapter, and critical thinking questions. Dillion Delivers! Patricia M. Dillon's new 2nd edition of Nursing Health Assessment: A Critical Thinking, Case Studies Approach delivers what you've been asking for - an alternative to books that present health assessment as a collection of techniques with no integrated focus. Dillon delivers an innovative approach that engages students in the assessment process through three important retention-developing features: Body Systems Integration - outlined clearly in illustrations. Teaches your students to see the relationships among the various body systems. Case Studies - woven through the chapters. Gives meaning to the assessment and essentially states, "You are assessing this patient!" to your students. Critical Thinking - introduced up front and integrated throughout all the chapters. Asks your students to think as they learn the assessment process and to apply what they've learned. Dillon delivers in her updated 2nd edition with the key features (see below) that you wanted - features designed to make your students think, learn and do!
